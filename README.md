## Bah-Bah-Grass

Multiplayer game made using the P5.party library.

### Game Instructions

Use your A,S,W,D keys or your ARROWS to move your sheep along the grass field. Eat the grass by jumping on top of each grass square.
The goal is for you and the other player to eat all the grass before the timer runs, shown in the bottom right.
Watch out for the farmer though—every time he appears, a seed appears with him. Get to the seed before the farmer timer runs out, or else the whole row will grow back!
