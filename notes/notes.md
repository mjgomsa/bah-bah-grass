# Notes Bah-Bah-Grass

# Assets

.nomalize sound levels

# Wait for new art

.sprites should be sized as used, so we wouldn't need to rescale on draw

# Bugs

x.bug, game doesn't restart properly. is timer reset?
x.round doesn't start unless host is on play screen

# Improvements

.refactor draw grid, to use all sprites and rethink how alts are drawn

# Features

.lobby/waiting room, sync game start, no
.reset everything on new game start
.make it so that initial grass square is eaten

.constantly assign observers to open sheep/ram roles ONLY if they are in the play screen

.sheep and ram can move before timer starts
.sheep and ram can EAT after timer starts
.timer starts if there is a sheep and ram

.finish seed growth
.when should seeds spawn?
.what should grass grow pattern be?

.how should scoring work: your score is the number of eaten squares when the timer runs out
