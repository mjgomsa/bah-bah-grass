# Notes Bah-Bah-Grass

### Main

- figure out restart trigger.. currently commented out

### To Ask:

1. How to organize play.js... like create different files for grid, sheep etc.

- stuck on seed.show seed.hide.

Basically theres one function replantGrass that inserts the seed image-- but later within that function I remove the image (previously when it was a DOM img, I would use .show, .hide) and

- also sheep and ram functionality (aka players) not working yet

# Todo

.organize assets with folders (images, fonts) etc.
.asset file names consistent case snake_case
